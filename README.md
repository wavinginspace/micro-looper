Space Looper is an app for generating infinite sounds.

To use, simply search for sounds and click on them to load into the player, where you can loop/reverse and manipulate the speed, pitch, grain and delay of the sound. 

Pressing the record button will record and automatically export whatever is playing and download as a wav file.
