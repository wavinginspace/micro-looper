To use, simply search for samples via FreeSound and click on a result to load into the player, where you can loop, reverse, manipulate the speed, pitch, grain, delay speed and delay feedback amount of the current loaded sample. You can also audition results by clicking on the play icon on right side of each result.

Pressing the record button will record and automatically export whatever is playing and download as a wav file.

Please create an issue if you encounter any problems.
